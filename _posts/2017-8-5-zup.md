**Zup** was an **offline payment** application. It used *QR-code* for payment between the user and the vendor ( shopkeeper). For the user
application, I reduced the *network latency* making the app work even on 2g networks. I increased the app responsiveness,  implemented timed 
pattern lock, short lived tokens for security and transaction history feature. I also obfuscated the code for both user and vendor application 
before the v2.0 release on play store.
