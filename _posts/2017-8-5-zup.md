**Zup** is an **offline payment** application. It uses *QR-code* for payment between the user and the vendor, where the user can also pay when he / 
she is offline. For the user application, I reduced the *network latency* making the app work smoothly on 2g networks. I increased the app 
responsiveness,  implemented timed pattern lock, increased security by implementing short-lived tokens and made transaction history feature. 
I also obfuscated the code for both user and vendor application before the v2.0 release on play store.
