**Bitotsav** was the official android app of cultural fest BITOTSAV 2017 of **BIT Mesra**. The app provided 
various features such as details of events happening, quick updates via push notifications, offline experience, 
registration for students attending the fest, entry-tickets, purchase of fest t-shirts, and alumni support.


The UI was based on *material design* guidelines with smooth animations using custom views.
It consumed a *RESTful API* using *Retrofit* and *RxJava* for fetching details of events, registrations and
keeping track of student attending. *Firebase* was used for push notifications and *NOSQL database Realm*
was used for caching to provide an offline experience and minimize network usage. *Webviews* with
server-side validation was used for payments of entry-tickets, t-shirts and alumni support using ZUP payment SDK.
