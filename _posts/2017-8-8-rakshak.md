A PGP end-to-end **encrypted generic email client** developed for Smart India Hackathon.
It uses standard mail protocols - *IMAP and SMTP, Java Mail, Cryptography and Security API*. The app provides security from email service providers
(like Gmail and Microsoft Outlook) who reads users private emails for analytical and ad purposes. It provides a generic interface, which allows the 
user to use their existing email service provider, or use our mail service to get an encrypted email channel. Our mail service used *Mail-in-a-Box* 
software bundle. **AES** (Advanced Encryption Standard) and **RSA** ( Asymmetric Key Algorithm) algorithms are used for providing security.
