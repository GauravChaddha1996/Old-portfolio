A **Pokémon-themed card maker and Pokédex app**. The user could browse the first generation pokédex and edit 
pokémons cards. The user could also create their own pokémon cards. They could also save and share those cards with
their friends. It used *material design*, android design support library, *python* scripts to scrape data from Pokémon 
APIs, *Android File APIs* to store user cards images, and *SQLlite* to store data of user cards. It used design patterns such as 
adapter pattern (pokédex list adapter), facade pattern (SQLlite helper) and state pattern (CardDetail and EditCard fragment).
