**Visio** helps visually-impaired people understand and feel what their friends are sharing with the world on social media. It was made during Hack 
in the north 2017. We used **Microsoft Cognitive Services** - *artificial intelligence*, *image and sentiment analysis* and *text-to-speech 
technology* to analyze the social media content, and give that understanding to our user in the easiest possible way. The project used Node.js as 
the backend and embedded javascript as the view engine along with Twitter's REST API for data fetches.
