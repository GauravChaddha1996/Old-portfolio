**Witworks** is a consumer **IoT** company making smartwatches and home devices. I worked on the **Bluetooth** connected smartwatch **Blink** 
running **Marvin**, an Android-based OS customized for smartwatches. I developed 3 core application for Marvin: Settings, Dialer, and Fitness 
application. 

1. **Settings application** was baked in with small features such as 'wake on twistâ€™ gesture, OTA updates, low power reminders etc.
2. **Dialer application** had features to see contacts, make calls, receive calls and messages, all from the smartwatch app. 
3. **Fitness application** showed steps, exercise time and calories for the day calculated with an accurate step-counting algorithm. It also had 
features like exercise selection and timed activity sessions, syncing data with the android phone app.

I also implemented the **voice command** feature on *Blink*, reducing the latency in converting the command to text, using *Bluetooth SCO* data 
link. I also worked on making a networking component on the blink companion Android app, **Witapp**. The component acted as an abstraction service 
which executed network calls on your behalf and returned the result to you. The OTA updater also used this module to download updates.
