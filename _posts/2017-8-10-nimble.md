**Intugine technologies** is a Bangalore based startup making gesture and voice-based wearables. I worked on 
**Nimble**, a motion sensing ring to control devices around you. It uses **BLE** (Bluetooth Low Energy) for connectivity. I developed the android application of Nimble.

1. Designed and developed robust architecture of the Nimble Android app. It follows the *S.O.L.I.D. principles*, *modularity* and *OOPS* concepts.
 It also uses MVP architectural pattern and design patterns such as observer, strategy, chain of responsibility pattern etc.
2. Increased data transfer rate between Nimble and app by 30x and achieved automatic reconnection of Nimble and app.
3. Developed and implemented ’Point and control’ and ’Custom gesture detection’ algorithms.

Apart from Nimble, I developed various enterprise solutions using Android Sensor API, Java WebSockets and NanoHttpd, MySQL, Node.js, Google play services etc.
