I'm a final year student doing my **B.E.** degree in **I.T.**(Information Technology) at **BIT Mesra, India**. I've been doing software 
development for about 2 years. I have **3 internship experiences** developing awesome products with great teams, have done **various interesting 
projects** and have participated in many fun **hackathons**. I have coding experience in **Android** and **Java** but I'm interested in **learning 
new things** and applying them to do new stuff. 
<h4>I'm looking for a full-time offer or 6-month internship or both!</h4>
